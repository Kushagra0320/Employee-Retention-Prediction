# 🧠 Employee Retention Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether an employee will stay or leave a company, built using classification algorithms and deployed with Streamlit. The goal is to assist HR teams in identifying attrition risks early based on employee engagement and performance data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and deploy a predictive system that helps businesses understand key factors behind employee churn and make data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **EDA** to explore patterns between satisfaction, workload, promotions, and attrition.
- 🧪 **Model Training** with Random Forest and XGBoost for better classification.
- 📈 Achieved high accuracy using optimized hyperparameters.
- 🌐 **Deployed using Streamlit** with an intuitive user interface for real-time predictions.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- XGBoost, RandomForestClassifier
- Streamlit for Web UI
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA
- Pickle for model serialization
