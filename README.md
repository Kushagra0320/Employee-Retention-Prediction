# Employee-Retention-Prediction
This project aims to analyze employee data and build a machine learning model to predict employee churn (i.e., whether an employee is likely to leave the company). The objective is to assist HR departments in identifying at-risk employees and taking proactive steps to improve retention.
The project is structured into two main parts:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzes patterns and correlations in employee data.

Visualizes features such as job satisfaction, evaluation scores, and work-life balance.

Identifies key factors contributing to employee attrition.

Model Training:

Preprocesses data and trains multiple machine learning models.

Compares model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Deploys the best-performing model for churn prediction.
